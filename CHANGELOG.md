## [2024.12.4] - 2024-12-04


> <u>**NOTE:**</u>
>
> This marks a major update to the style guide. The guide has been completely rewritten and converted to "MkDocs + Material for MkDocs". However, please note I don't consider this the "final" version of this rewrite. While 99% of the guidelines are ready for use, I want to modify the wording quite a bit, as I think I need to write it in a more easy-to-understand way. Consider this release a "beta" version of the rewrite.
