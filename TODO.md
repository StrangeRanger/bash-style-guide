# TODO

## Small TODOs

- Instead of just saying, "It makes things more clear," explain how it makes things more clear. (Inside the Aesthetics section)
- Ensure terminology is consistent and correct throughout the document. (e.g., "Block statements" vs. "Control statements")
- Ensure to include a part in (some section) mentioning that global variables should often be placed at the top of the script. This ensure that the script isn't reliant on variables defined within a function... (or something like that)

## Big(ger) TODOs

- Add a section explaining the perils of using `eval` and why it should be avoided.
- Add a section explaining how to properly use `set -e`.
- Add information regarding how to deal with logical operators, similar to that of inside "Formatting Multi-lined Commands".
