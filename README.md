Over the years, I've written a lot of Bash scripts. Some of them have been good, some of them have been bad, and some of them have been downright ugly. This guide is an attempt to distill the lessons I've learned into a set of best practices for writing safe, predictable, and maintainable Bash scripts.

The guidelines in this document are primarily based on [Wooledge's Bash Practices](http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide/Practices), which is an excellent resource for understanding the fundamentals of Bash scripting. If any practices are not explicitly mentioned in this guide, they should be considered to align with those outlined in the abovementioned wiki.

You are encouraged to fork this [guide on GitHub](https://github.com/StrangeRanger/bash-style-guide) for your own use and to contribute to its improvement.

As a note, this guide is a rewrite of the [Bash Style Guide](https://github.com/bahamas10/bash-style-guide) written by [bahamas10](https://github.com/bahamas10).
