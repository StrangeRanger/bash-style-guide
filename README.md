Over the past few years, I've written many Bash scriptsâ€”some good, some bad, and some downright ugly. This guide distills those experiences into a comprehensive set of best practices for writing safe, predictable, and maintainable Bash scripts.

Whether you're a beginner looking to avoid common pitfalls or an experienced developer seeking to improve your scripting practices, this guide provides practical advice on error handling, code style, performance considerations, and security practices.

The guide expands significantly upon [bahamas10's Bash Style Guide](https://github.com/bahamas10/bash-style-guide) and incorporates foundational principles from [Wooledge's Bash Practices](http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide/Practices). Any practices not explicitly covered here generally align with those resources.
