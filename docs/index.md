This Bash Style Guide provides detailed recommendations for writing safe and predictable bash scripts. The guidelines are primarily based on [Wooledge's Bash Practices](http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide/Practices), which is an excellent resource for understanding the fundamentals of Bash scripting.

If any practices are not explicitly mentioned in this guide, they should be considered to align with those outlined in the abovementioned wiki. You are encouraged to fork this [guide on GitHub](https://github.com/StrangeRanger/bash-style-guide) for your own use and to contribute to its improvement.

## Preface

This guide aims to be as objective as possible by providing well-founded reasons for each recommended practice. It covers both functional and aesthetic scripting choices, although for purely stylistic preferences that may vary, please refer to the [Aesthetics](guidelines/aesthetics.md) section.

## Report Issues

If you find any issues with this guide, whether it be a typo, a broken link, or a suggestion for improvement, please create an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/StrangeRanger/bash-style-guide/issues).
