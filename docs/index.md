This Bash Style Guide offers detailed recommendations for writing safe, predictable, and maintainable Bash scripts. It is a complete rewrite of the [Bash Style Guide](https://github.com/bahamas10/bash-style-guide) by [bahamas10](https://github.com/bahamas10), drawing inspiration from the core concepts and ideas in [Wooledge's Bash Practices](http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide/Practices). While this guide expands upon and reinterprets those foundational principles, any practices not explicitly covered here should be assumed to align with the standards outlined in the referenced resources.

You are encouraged to fork this [guide on GitHub](https://github.com/StrangeRanger/bash-style-guide) for your own use and to contribute to its improvement.

## Preface

This guide strives to be as objective as possible by providing well-founded reasons for each recommended practice. It covers both functional and aesthetic scripting choices. For stylistic preferences that may vary, please refer to the [Aesthetics](guidelines/aesthetics.md) section.

## Report Issues
