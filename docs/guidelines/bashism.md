# Bashisms

As a reminder, this style guide is intended for Bash. When given a choice, <mark>**_ALWAYS_**</mark> prefer Bash built-ins or keywords over external commands or `sh(1)` syntax.

This section covers common Bashisms, which are idiomatic practices and features specific to the Bash shell. By understanding and utilizing these Bash-specific constructs, you can write scripts that are more efficient, readable, and robust.

## Conditional Tests

Conditional tests are fundamental to any programming language, enabling decision-making based on evaluating expressions. Bash provides several constructs for these tests, including `[ ... ]`, `[[ ... ]]`, and the `test` command.

/// admonition | Guidelines
    type: info

- **Use `[[ ... ]]`:** <mark>**_ALWAYS_**</mark> use the `[[ ... ]]` construct for conditional tests.
- **Avoid `[ ... ]` and `test`:** Avoid using `[ ... ]` and the `test` command for conditional tests.

///

/// admonition | Advantages of `[[ ... ]]`
    type: tip

- **Regex Support**: Enables direct regex matching within conditional expressions, eliminating the need for external tools like `grep`.
- **String Comparison**: Offers a more consistent and reliable approach to string comparison, especially when dealing with variables containing spaces or special characters.
- **Compound Conditions**: Allows combining multiple conditions within a single `[[ ... ]]` block, simplifying logic and improving readability.
- **Safety**: Prevents word splitting and globbing on variables, reducing the risk of unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.

///

/// details | Examples
    type: example
//// tab | Basic String Comparison

_Using `[ ... ]`:_

```bash
var="value with spaces"

if [ $var = "value with spaces" ]; then
    echo "The variable matches the value."
else
    echo "This will output because '$var' is treated as multiple arguments."
fi
```

**Potential Issues**: Without proper quoting, `[ ... ]` can cause unexpected behavior due to word splitting, treating the variable as multiple arguments.

---

_Using `[[ ... ]]`:_

```bash
var="value with spaces"

if [[ $var == "value with spaces" ]]; then
    echo "The variable matches the value."
else
    echo "This will output because $var is treated as multiple arguments."
fi
```

**Advantage**: `[[ ... ]]` safely handles variables with spaces, whether or not they are quoted.

////
//// tab | Regex Matching

_Using `grep` for regex matching:_

```bash
email="hunter@hthompson.dev"

if echo "$email" | grep -qE '^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$'; then
    echo "Valid email address."
else
    echo "Invalid email address."
fi
```

**Disadvantage**: Since `grep` is an external command, the potential for errors and performance issues increases due to different implementations across systems.

---

_Using `[[ ... ]]` for regex matching:_

```bash
email="hunter@hthompson.dev"

if [[ "$email" =~ ^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$ ]]; then
    echo "Valid email address."
else
    echo "Invalid email address."
fi
```

**Advantage**: `[[ ... ]]` directly supports regex matching, eliminating the need for external commands and enhancing script portability.

////
//// tab | Compound Conditions

_Using `[ ... ]` for compound conditions:_

```bash
file="example.txt"

touch "$file" && chmod 700 "$file"

if [ -f "$file" ] && [ -r "$file" ] || [ -w "$file" ]; then
    echo "File exists and is readable and/or writable."
else
    echo "File is either missing, unreadable, or unwritable."
fi
```

**Disadvantage**: `[ ... ]` does not support compound conditions directly, requiring additional commands or constructs to achieve the desired behavior.

---

_Using `[[ ... ]]` for compound conditions:_

```bash
file="example.txt"

touch "$file" && chmod 700 "$file"

if [[ -f $file && -r $file || -w $file ]]; then
    echo "File exists and is readable and/or writable."
else
    echo "File is either missing, unreadable, or unwritable."
fi
```

**Advantage**: `[[ ... ]]` supports compound conditions, simplifying script logic and improving readability.

## Command Substitution

Command substitution allows you to capture the output of commands and use it as part of another command or assignment. Bash provides two syntaxes for command substitution: `$(...)` and backticks (`` `...` ``).



/// admonition | Guidelines
    type: info

- **Use `$(...)`:** <mark>**_ALWAYS_**</mark> use the `$(...)` syntax for command substitution instead of backticks.
- **Avoid Backticks**: Avoid using backticks for command substitution.

///

/// admonition | Advantages of `$(...)`
    type: tip

- **Improved Readability**: The `$(...)` format is visually clearer, making scripts easier to read and understand, especially as commands become more complex.
- **Easier Nesting**: Facilitates the nesting of multiple commands without the syntactic awkwardness associated with backticks.
- **Enhanced Safety**: The `$(...)` syntax is more robust and less prone to errors, particularly in complex command substitutions.

///

/// details | Examples
    type: example
//// tab | Basic Command Substitution

_Using backticks:_

```bash
output=`ls -l`
echo "The output is: $output"
```

---

_Using `$(...)`_

```bash
output=$(ls -l)
echo "The output is: $output"
```

**Explanation**: The `$(...)` syntax is clearer and preferred for command substitution.

////
//// tab | Nesting Command Substitution

_Using backticks:_

```bash
date_and_users=`echo "Date: \`date\` - Users: \`who | wc -l\`"`
echo $date_and_users
```

---

_Using `$(...)`:_

```bash
date_and_users=$(echo "Date: $(date) - Users: $(who | wc -l)")
echo $date_and_users
```

**Explanation**: Nesting commands with `$(...)` is easier to read and less error-prone compared to using backticks.

////

## Arithmetic Operations

Arithmetic operations allow for mathematical calculations within Bash, enabling you to perform calculations, comparisons, and other numeric operations. Bash supports arithmetic operations using arithmetic expansions `$((...))`, conditional arithmetic expressions `((...))`, and the `let` command.

/// admonition | Guidelines
    type: info

- **Use `$((...))` and `((...))`**: <mark>**_ALWAYS_**</mark> use `$((...))` for arithmetic expansions and `((...))` for conditional arithmetic expressions.
- **Avoid `let`**: Avoid using `let` for arithmetic.
- **Reasoning**: `$((...))` and `((...))` provide a clearer and more intuitive syntax for arithmetic operations in Bash.

///

/// admonition | Advantages of `$((...))` and `((...))`
    type: tip

- **Clarity**: Both `((...))` and `$((...))` clearly delineate arithmetic expressions within scripts, making them easy to identify and understand.
- **Simplicity**: These constructs are natively supported by Bash, offering a streamlined and intuitive approach to handling arithmetic.
- **Increased Safety**: These methods specifically evaluate arithmetic without the risk of executing other commands, unlike let, which can misinterpret expressions as commands if not carefully handled.

///

/// details | Examples
    type: example
//// tab | Basic Arithmetic

_Using `let`:_

```bash
let result=1+2
echo "Result: $result"
```

---

_Using `$((...))`:_

## Avoiding Parsing `ls`

While parsing the output of `ls` may seem like a convenient way to list files and directories, this approach is generally discouraged due to the potential for errors and unexpected behavior. Instead, Bash provides more reliable and secure methods for file and directory parsing, such as Bash globbing patterns (`*`).

/// admonition | Guidelines
    type: info

- **Bash Built-ins**: <mark>**_ALWAYS_**</mark> use Bash globbing patterns like `*` or tools like `find` for file and directory parsing.
- **Avoid Using `ls`**: Avoid using `ls` in loops or where accurate filename interpretation is critical.

///

/// admonition | Risks of Parsing `ls`
    type: warning

- **Word Splitting**: Filenames with spaces or special characters can cause word splitting issues when parsing `ls` output.
- **Command Interpretation**: Filenames starting with a hyphen (`-`) can be misinterpreted as options by commands like `ls`, leading to unintended behavior.
- **Potential Vulnerabilities**: Although parsing `ls` output may not directly cause security vulnerabilities like code injection, improper handling of filenames can introduce bugs or unexpected behavior, which may lead to security issues in more complex scenarios.

///

/// admonition | Alternatives to Parsing `ls`
    type: tip

- **Bash Globing**: Use Bash globbing patterns like `*` for listing files and directories, ensuring reliable and secure file parsing.
- **`find` Command**: For more complex file operations, consider using the `find` command, which provides extensive options for file and directory traversal.
- **`read` Command**: When processing files or directories, use the `read` command to safely parse inputs into variables, avoiding the need for external commands like `ls`.
- **`stat` Command**: For detailed file information, use the `stat` command, which provides extensive metadata about files and directories.
- **`file` Command**: To determine file types, use the `file` command, which can identify the type of a file based on its contents.

///
