# Bashisms

As a reminder, this style guide is designed specifically for Bash scripting. When given a choice, <mark>**_ALWAYS_**</mark> prefer Bash built-ins or keywords over external commands or `sh(1)` syntax.

This section focuses on common Bashisms, which are shell features or commands unique to Bash. Using these Bash-specific constructs can improve your scripts' efficiency, portability (1), readability (2), and robustness.
{ .annotate }

1. **Efficiency and Portability**: Bashisms provide built-in functionalities that are more efficient and portable than external commands or purely [POSIX](https://mywiki.wooledge.org/POSIX)-compliant syntax. By leveraging these features, you can write scripts that execute faster and run on any system where Bash is available, without relying on external tools.
2. **Readability**: While Bashisms generally improve readability, some features, such as the parameter expansion syntax, may be confusing for beginners. However, the robustness and efficiency they offer make them worth learning.

## Conditional Tests

Conditional tests are essential in any programming language, allowing decision-making based on evaluating expressions. Bash provides several constructs for these tests, including `[ ... ]`, `[[ ... ]]`, and the `test` command.

/// admonition | Guidelines
    type: info

- **Use `[[ ... ]]`:** <mark>**_ALWAYS_**</mark> use the `[[ ... ]]` construct when performing conditional tests.
- **Avoid Using `[ ... ]` and `test`:** <mark>**_DO NOT_**</mark> use `[ ... ]` and the `test` command for conditional tests.

///

/// admonition | Advantages of `[[ ... ]]`
    type: tip

- **Regex Support**: Enables direct regex matching within conditional expressions, eliminating the need for external tools like `grep`.
- **String Comparison**: Provides a consistent and reliable method for string comparison, especially when dealing with variables containing spaces or special characters.
- **Compound Conditions**: Allows multiple conditions to be combined within a single `[[ ... ]]` block, simplifying logic and improving readability.
- **Safety**: Prevents [word splitting](https://mywiki.wooledge.org/WordSplitting) and [globbing](https://mywiki.wooledge.org/glob) on variables, reducing the risk of unexpected behavior.

///

/// details | Examples
    type: example
//// tab | Basic String Comparison

_Using `[ ... ]`:_

```bash
var="value with spaces"

if [ $var = "value with spaces" ]; then
    echo "The variable matches the value."
else
    echo "This will output because '$var' is treated as multiple arguments."
fi
```

**Potential Issues**: Without proper quoting, `[ ... ]` may cause unexpected behaviors due to word splitting, treating the variable as multiple arguments.

---

_Using `[[ ... ]]`:_

```bash
var="value with spaces"

if [[ $var == "value with spaces" ]]; then
    echo "The variable matches the value."
else
    echo "This will output because $var is treated as multiple arguments."
fi
```

**Advantage**: `[[ ... ]]` safely handles variables with spaces, whether or not they are quoted.

////
//// tab | Regex Matching

_Using `grep` for regex matching:_

```bash
email="hunter@hthompson.dev"

if echo "$email" | grep -qE '^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$'; then
    echo "Valid email address."
else
    echo "Invalid email address."
fi
```

**Disadvantage**: `grep` is an external command, which can introduce errors and performance issues (though negligible) due to differing implementations across different operating systems.

---

_Using `[[ ... ]]` for regex matching:_

```bash
email="hunter@hthompson.dev"

if [[ "$email" =~ ^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$ ]]; then
    echo "Valid email address."
else
    echo "Invalid email address."
fi
```

**Advantage**: `[[ ... ]]` directly supports regex matching, eliminating the need for external commands and enhancing script portability.

////
//// tab | Compound Conditions

_Using `[ ... ]` for compound conditions:_

```bash
file="example.txt"

touch "$file" && chmod 700 "$file"

if [ -f "$file" ] && [ -r "$file" ] || [ -w "$file" ]; then
    echo "File exists and is readable and/or writable."
else
    echo "File is either missing, unreadable, or unwritable."
fi
```

**Disadvantage**: `[ ... ]` does not support compound conditions directly, requiring additional commands or constructs.

---

_Using `[[ ... ]]` for compound conditions:_

```bash
file="example.txt"

touch "$file" && chmod 700 "$file"

if [[ -f $file && -r $file || -w $file ]]; then
    echo "File exists and is readable and/or writable."
else
    echo "File is either missing, unreadable, or unwritable."
fi
```

**Advantage**: `[[ ... ]]` supports compound conditions, simplifying logic and enhancing readability.

## Sequence Iteration

Iterating over sequences is a common task in Bash, allowing you to process elements in a range or list. Bash offers built-in mechanisms for sequence iteration, such as brace expansion and C-style `for` loops.

/// admonition | Guidelines
    type: info

- **Bash Built-ins**: <mark>**_ALWAYS_**</mark> use brace expansion (`{start..end}`) for fixed ranges and the C-style `for` loop for variable limits when iterating over sequences.
- **Avoid Using `seq`:** <mark>**_DO NOT_**</mark> use `seq` for sequence iteration.

///

/// admonition | Advantages of Built-in Iteration
    type: tip

- **Simplicity**: Built-in mechanisms like brace expansion and C-style `for` loops are native to Bash, providing a straightforward and efficient way to iterate over sequences.
- **Reduced Dependencies**: Utilizing built-in features minimizes external dependencies, enhancing script reliability and maintainability.

## Command Substitution

[Command substitution](https://mywiki.wooledge.org/CommandSubstitution) allows you to capture the output of a command and use it as part of another command or assignment. Bash provides two syntaxes for command substitution: `$(...)` and backticks (`` `...` ``).


/// admonition | Guidelines
    type: info

- **Use `$(...)`**: <mark>**_ALWAYS_**</mark> use `$(...)` for command substitution instead of backticks.
- **Avoid Using Backticks**: <mark>**_DO NOT_**</mark> use backticks for command substitution.

///

/// admonition | Advantages of `$(...)`
    type: tip

- **Improved Readability**: `$(...)` is visually clearer, making scripts easier to read, particularly as commands grow in complexity.
- **Easier Nesting**: Facilitates nesting multiple commands without the syntactic awkwardness associated with backticks.
- **Enhanced Safety**: More robust and less prone to errors, especially in complex command substitutions.

///

/// details | Examples
    type: example
//// tab | Basic Command Substitution

_Using backticks:_

```bash
output=`ls -l`
echo "The output is: $output"
```

---

_Using `$(...)`_

```bash
output=$(ls -l)
echo "The output is: $output"
```

////
//// tab | Nesting Command Substitution

_Using backticks:_

```bash
date_and_users=`echo "Date: \`date\` - Users: \`who | wc -l\`"`
echo $date_and_users
```

**Disadvantage**: Nesting commands with backticks can be challenging to read and are often prone to errors.

---

_Using `$(...)`:_

```bash
date_and_users=$(echo "Date: $(date) - Users: $(who | wc -l)")
echo $date_and_users
```

**Advantage**: The `$(...)` syntax simplifies nested commands, improving readability and reducing the likelihood of errors.

////

## Arithmetic Operations

Arithmetic operations in Bash enable mathematical calculations, comparisons, and other numeric operations. Bash supports these operations using arithmetic expansions `$((...))`, conditional arithmetic expressions `((...))`, and the `let` command.

/// admonition | Guidelines
    type: info

- **Use `$((...))` and `((...))`**: <mark>**_ALWAYS_**</mark> use `$((...))` for arithmetic expansions and `((...))` for conditional arithmetic expressions.
- **Avoid Using `let`**: <mark>**_DO NOT_**</mark> use `let` for arithmetic operations.

///

/// admonition | Advantages of `$((...))` and `((...))`
    type: tip

- **Clarity**: Both `((...))` and `$((...))` explicitly indicate arithmetic operations within scripts, making them easier to understand.
- **Increased Safety**: Unlike `let`, these methods exclusively evaluate arithmetic expressions and do not risk executing other commands by mistake.

///

/// details | Examples
    type: example
//// tab | Basic Arithmetic

_Using `let`:_

```bash
let result=1+2
echo "Result: $result"
```

---

_Using `$((...))`:_

```bash
result=$(( 1 + 2 ))
echo "Result: $result"
```

////
//// tab | Conditional Arithmetic Expressions

_Using `let`:_

```bash
a=5
b=10

if let "a < b"; then
    echo "a is less than b"
fi
```

---

_Using `((...))`:_

```bash
a=5
b=10

if (( a < b )); then
    echo "a is less than b"
fi
```

---

**Explanation**: `((...))` provides a more concise and readable way to evaluate arithmetic expressions within conditional statements.

////
///

## Parameter Expansion

[Parameter expansion](https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide/Parameters#Parameter_Expansion) in Bash allows you to manipulate variables and perform string operations directly within the shell. It offers a wide range of options, including substring extraction, string replacement, and transformations.
{ .annotate }

/// admonition | Guidelines
    type: info

- **Use Parameter Expansion**: Use parameter expansion for tasks such as string manipulation, default value assignment, and pattern matching.
- **Limit Use of External Tools**: Minimize the use of tools like `sed` and `awk` for string manipulation unless advanced text processing is required and cannot be handled by Bash.
    - **Rationale**: While powerful, these tools are often unnecessary for tasks that can be performed efficiently using parameter expansion.

///

/// admonition | Advantages of Parameter Expansion
    type: tip

- **Streamlined Scripting**: Keeps string manipulations inline and shell-native, simplifying the script's logic.
- **Enhanced Portability**: Enhances script portability across different Unix-like systems by avoiding dependencies on external tools that may not be available or consistent in functionality.

///

/// details | Examples
    type: example
//// tab | Extracting Substrings

_Using `sed`_

```bash
string="Hello, World!"
substring=$(echo "$string" | sed 's/Hello,//')

echo "$substring"
```

---

_Using Parameter Expansion_

```bash
string="Hello, World!"
substring=${string/Hello,/}

echo "$substring"
```

---

**Explanation**: Parameter expansion offers a more direct and efficient way to extract substrings compared to using external tools like `sed`.

////
//// tab | Removing a Suffix

_Using `awk`_

```bash
filename="document.txt"
basename=$(echo $filename | awk -F. '{print $1}')

echo $basename
```

---

_Using Parameter Expansion_

```bash
filename="document.txt"
basename=${filename%.txt}
echo $basename
```

---

**Explanation**: Parameter expansion simplifies the removal of suffixes from filenames and is more efficient than using external commands like `awk`.

////
//// tab | String Length

_Using `wc`_

```bash
string="Hello, World!"
length=$(echo -n $string | wc -c)
echo $length
```

---

_Using Parameter Expansion_

```bash
string="Hello, World!"
length=${#string}
echo $length
```

---

**Explanation**: Parameter expansion provides a more straightforward and efficient method for determining the length of a string compared to using external commands like `wc`.

////
///

## Avoid Parsing `ls`

Parsing the output of `ls` in Bash scripts can result in errors and unpredictable behavior, especially when dealing with filenames that contain spaces or special characters. Instead, Unix-like systems provide safer and more reliable alternatives for handling files and directories, such as Bash globbing, `find`, and `read`.

/// admonition | Guidelines
    type: info

- **Bash Built-ins**: <mark>**_ALWAYS_**</mark> use Bash globbing patterns (`*`) or commands like `find` for file and directory operations to ensure reliable handling.
- **Avoid Using `ls`**: <mark>**_DO NOT_**</mark> use `ls` in scripts where accurate filename interpretation is necessary, such as in loops or complex operations.

///

/// admonition | Risks of Parsing `ls`
    type: warning

- **Word Splitting**: Filenames with spaces or special characters may cause unintended word splitting when processed by `ls`, leading to errors.
- **Command Misinterpretation**: Filenames that begin with a hyphen (`-`) may be interpreted as command-line options, potentially causing unintended behavior.
- **Potential Vulnerabilities**: Improper handling of filenames can introduce bugs or security vulnerabilities, especially in more complex scripts.

///

/// admonition | Alternatives to Parsing `ls`
    type: tip

- **Bash Globbing**: Use Bash globbing patterns (like `*`) to list files and directories. This method is safer and more reliable for handling filenames with special characters.
- **`find` Command**: Use the `find` command for complex file operations, which provides extensive options for searching and handling files.
- **`read` Command**: Use `read` with the appropriate settings to safely process filenames without relying on external commands like `ls`.
- **`stat` Command**: Use `stat` to obtain detailed file information, such as size, permissions, and modification times.
- **`file` Command**: Use `file` to identify the type of a file based on its content, rather than its extension.

///

/// details | Examples
    type: example
//// tab | Listing Files in a Directory

<!-- TODO: Maybe add "potential issues" or "disadvantages" for each example? -->

_Using `ls` in a loop:_

```bash
for file in $(ls /path/to/dir); do
    echo "Processing $file"
done
```

---

_Using Bash Globing:_

```bash
for file in /path/to/dir/*; do
    echo "Processing $(basename "$file")"
done
```

---

**Explanation**: Bash globbing uses patterns like `*` to match filenames directly in the specified directory, eliminating the need for external commands like `ls`. This approach ensures that filenames with spaces, newlines, or special characters are handled correctly by the shell. Using glob patterns (e.g., `/path/to/dir/*`), the shell expands them into a list of matching filenames, making this method more secure and reliable.

////
//// tab | Using `find` for File Operations

<!-- TODO: Maybe add "potential issues" or "disadvantages" for each example? -->

_Using `ls` with wildcards:_

```bash
for file in $(ls /path/to/dir/*.txt); do
    echo "Processing $file"
done
```

---

_Using `find`:_

```bash
find /path/to/dir -type f -name "*.txt" -exec echo "Processing {}" \;
```

---

**Explanation**: The `find` command offers robust and flexible options for file searching and operations, making it more suitable for handling complex tasks than `ls`. It provides precise control over which files are selected and how they are processed.

////
//// tab | Parsing Filenames with `read`

<!-- TODO: Maybe add "potential issues" or "disadvantages" for each example? -->

_Using `ls` with `while` loop:_

```bash
ls /path/to/dir > filelist.txt

_Using `find` and `read`:_

```bash
find /path/to/dir -type f > filelist.txt
while IFS= read -r file; do
    echo "Processing $file"
done < filelist.txt
```

---

**Explanation**: Setting the `IFS` (Internal Field Separator) correctly with `read` ensures that filenames containing spaces or special characters are processed safely. This method avoids the risks associated with parsing the output of `ls`.

```

---

**Explanation**: `stat` provides more comprehensive metadata about a file than `ls -l`, such as size, permissions, and modification times.

////
//// tab | Determining File Type

<!-- TODO: Maybe add "potential issues" or "disadvantages" for each example? -->

_Using `ls` with file extension check:_

```bash
if [[ $(ls /path/to/file) == *.txt ]]; then
    echo "This is a text file"
fi
```

---

_Using `file`:_

```bash
file_type=$(file --mime-type -b /path/to/file)
if [[ $file_type == "text/plain" ]]; then
    echo "This is a text file"
fi
```

---

**Explanation**: The `file` command examines the contents of a file to determine its type, offering a more accurate method than relying solely on file extensions.

```bash
input="username:password"
IFS=':' read -r username password <<< "$input"
echo "Username: $username, Password: $password"
```

**Advantage**: `read` directly parses the input into variables, reducing complexity and improving readability.

////
///

## Efficient Array Population

The `mapfile` command, also known as `readarray`, is a Bash built-in that provides an efficient way to populate an array with lines from a file or the output of a command. This command simplifies the process of reading and storing multiline data, making it particularly useful when working with large datasets or when you need to process input line by line.

/// admonition | Guidelines
    type: info

- **Use `mapfile` for Multiline Input**: When you need to read and store multiline data into an array, prefer mapfile over looping constructs.
- **Specify a Delimiter with `-d`**: Use the `-d` option to specify a custom delimiter if the input data is not newline-separated.
- **Avoid Excessive Loops**: `mapfile` can efficiently replace complex loops that read and store data line by line, improving script readability and performance.

///

/// admonition | Advantages of `mapfile`
    type: tip

- **Efficiency**: `mapfile` reads an entire stream into an array at once, making it faster and more efficient than reading lines individually in a loop.
- **Simplicity**: The command reduces the amount of code required to populate arrays, leading to cleaner and more maintainable scripts.
- **Flexibility**: With options like `-t` (to remove trailing newlines) and `-d` (to specify a delimiter), mapfile offers flexibility in handling various input formats.
