# Aesthetics

As mentioned in the [Preface](/#preface), this guide aims to be as objective as possible by providing well-founded reasons for each recommended practice. However, some practices are purely stylistic and may vary based on personal preference or specific project requirements.

This section addresses these aesthetic choices and provides guidelines for maintaining a consistent and visually appealing script style. Where applicable, the guidelines are accompanied by explanations of their benefits over alternative practices. For style guidelines that are less subjective and have a more significant impact on script functionality, refer to the [Style](/content/style) section.

## Indentations

Indentations help structure code, making it more readable and easier to follow.

/// admonition | Guidelines
    type: tip

- **Indent Size**: Use four spaces for each indentation level to balance readability and space efficiency.

///

### Why Spaces Over Tabs?

Spaces are preferred over tabes because they render uniformly across all editing environments, reducing misalignment issues. Additionally, using spaces can help minimize merge conflicts in version control systems, making it safer for projects involving multiple contributors.

## Column Length

The column length is the number of characters in a single line of code. Limiting the column length can help maintain the readability of your code.

/// admonition | General Guidelines
    type: tip

- **88-Character Limit**: Keep lines within 88 characters.
- **Exceptions**: Allow exceptions when dealing with long strings, URLs, complex expressions, or configuration lines that require clarity and are more understandable when not broken into multiple lines.

///

/// details | Examples
//// tab | Line Continuation

_Breaking a long command into multiple lines_

```bash
tar -czvf /backup/archive-$(date +%F).tar.gz /home/user/documents \
    /home/user/photos /home/user/videos
```

////
//// tab | Exceeding 88 Characters

_Example of a long URL that exceeds the 88-character limit_

```bash
url="https://www.example.com/this/is/a/very/long/url/that/contains/a/lot/of/subdirectories/and/parameters?param1=value1&param2=value2&param3=value3&param4=value4&param5=value5"
```

////
///

### Formatting Multi-lined Commands

When breaking long commands into multiple lines, it is essential to ensure that it remains readable and easy to follow. Below are some effective guidelines for aligning, indenting, and placing operators (such as `||` and `&&`).

/// admonition | Guidelines
    type: tip

//// tab | Indentation and Alignment

- **Indentation**: Use a standard four-space indentation for each continuation line. This ensures consistency and readability across different scripts.

///// admonition | Example

_A standard four-space indentation_

```bash
tar -czvf /backup/archive-$(date +%F).tar.gz /home/user/documents \
    /home/user/photos /home/user/videos

curl -X POST \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"username": "admin", "password": "secret"}' \
    http://example.com/api/login
```

/////
////
//// tab | Logical Operators

- **Placement**: When multiple commands are connected by logical operators (`&&`, `||`), place these operators at the beginning of a new line with a four-space indent. This helps visually separate the conditional execution of subsequent commands based on the SUCCESS or failure of the previous command.

///// admonition | Example

_Using logical operators with proper indentation_

```bash
cd /some/directory/in/a/universe/far/far/away \
    && echo "Directory change successful." \
    || echo "Failed to change directories."
```

/////
////
//// tab | Redirect and I/O Operators

- **Placement**: When breaking up a long command that includes redirect or I/O operators (such as `>`, `>>`, `<`, `|`), place these operators at the beginning of a new line with a four-space indent. This visual separation enhances the flow from one command to the next.

///// admonition | Example

_Using pipes and redirection operators with proper indentation_

```bash
grep "some very long pattern" /a/very/long/path/to/some/file/on/the/system \
    | sort \
    | uniq -c > error_summary.txt
```

/////
////
///

### Why Limit Line Length

- **Readability**: Shorter lines eliminate the need for horizontal scrolling, making the code easier to read across different devices and screen sizes.
- **Compatibility**: A standard line length ensures code displays well in various development tools, including code review platforms and IDEs.

## Function Declaration

While not greatly impacting script readability or functionality, there is a commonly preferred syntax for declaring functions in Bash.

/// admonition | Guidelines
    type: tip

- **Syntax**: Always declare functions using the name followed by parentheses and curly braces (`name() {}`), rather than the `function` keyword.

///

/// details | Examples

_Using the `function` keyword_

```bash
function foo {
    local i=foo
}
```

---

_Using the recommended syntax_

```bash
foo() {
    local i=foo
}
```

**Advantage**: The recommended syntax is more widely accepted and aligns with common Bash practices and community standards.

///

### Why Avoid the `function` Keyword

- **Convention**: The recommended syntax is a more widely accepted and conventional way of declaring functions in Bash, aligning with common Bash practices and community standards.

## Formatting Block Statement

Formatting block statements is a simple way of enhancing the readability of your code.

### Guidelines

- **Inline Placement**: Position `then` on the same line as `if` statements, and `do` on the same line as `for` or `while` loops.
- **New Line for Block Endings**: End `if` statements with `fi` and loops with `done` on their own lines to distinctly mark block terminations.

/// details | Examples
//// tab | BAD

```bash
if [[ -f "$file" ]]
then
    echo "File exists."
else
    echo "File does not exist."
fi
```

////
//// tab | GOOD

```bash
if [[ -f "$file" ]]; then
    echo "File exists."
else
    echo "File does not exist."
fi
```

////
///

### Why Format Block Statements

- **Convention**: This style aligns with common coding conventions and practices in the Bash scripting community, which can help ensure that your code is consistent with widely accepted standards.
- **Readability**: Placing `then` on the same line as the `if` statement clearly indicates that the subsequent block is conditional on the `if` statement, making the code easier to read and understand at a glance.

## Single Line Block Statement Guidelines

While Bash scripts typically benefit from multi-line formatting, single-line block statements can effectively handle simple conditional or loop executions.

### Guidelines

- **Clarity and Maintainability**: Single-line statements should be concise and clear to enhance readability, especially for straightforward conditions or loops. Always ensure that single-line statements preserve the scriptâ€™s logical structure, facilitating easier updates and understanding.
- **Avoid Clutter**: Refrain from adding multiple commands or complex logic to single-line statements. This helps maintain clarity and prevent code clutter.

/// details | Examples
//// tab | BAD

```bash
if [[ -f $file_name ]]; then echo "$file_name exists!"; echo "Done"; fi
```

////
//// tab | GOOD

```bash
if [[ -f $file_name ]]; then echo "$file_name exists!"; fi
```

////
///

## Vertical Spacing Guidelines

- **Single Blank Line**: A single blank line separates logical blocks of code or functions, facilitating quick visual parsing.
- **Double Blank Lines**: Employ up to two blank lines sparingly to highlight new sections or distinct logical groups within the script.

/// details | Examples

```bash
### Variable Section
variable="value"
variable2="value2"


### Function Section
function_name() {
    # Function code here.
}


### Main Script Section
# Main script code here.
```

///

## Comments

Comments are essential for explaining script functionality and enhancing long-term usability and readability. Effective commenting practices ensure scripts are accessible and easily understood by new developers or future maintainers.

### General Guidelines

- **Capitalization**: Begin each comment with a capital letter, except when referring to code elements like variables or functions.
- **Punctuation**: Conclude comments with a period to indicate completion and maintain consistency.
- **Spacing**: For inline comments, maintain two spaces between the code and and the comment.

/// details | Examples
//// tab | Recommended Commenting Style

```bash
# Assigns "True" to var and demonstrates proper comment formatting.
var=$(echo "True")  # This prints "True".

# Simple variable assignment with a clear, aligned comment.
box="Box"  # This is a box.
```

////
///

### Functions

Functions in bash differ in a few ways from those in other programming languages, especially in terms of argument handling. Due to these differences, functions should be thoroughly documented to clarify their purpose, parameters, and expected behavior.

#### Guidelines for Documenting Functions

- **Purpose**: Offer a concise description of the function's role and its operational context within the script.
- **Parameters**: Detail each parameter the function accepts, noting required versus optional parameters and any default values. Though not required, it's **_highly_** recommended assign parameter values to local variables for clarity.
- **Return Values**: Specify the function's output or return values, if applicable.

/// details | Examples

```bash
####
# This function processes files given as parameters and logs results. It is designed to
# handle a variable number of input files and demonstrate proper ERROR handling.
#
# Parameters:
#   - $1: input_file (Required)
#       - Path to the file that needs processing.
#   - $2: log_file (Required)
#       - File where the processing logs are stored.
#   - $3: debug_mode (Optional, Default: false)
#       - If set to true, the function will perform debugging operations.
process_files() {
    local input_file="$1"
    local log_file="$2"
    local debug_mode="${3:-false}"

    # Function code here.
}
```

### Pound Signs in Comments

#### Guidelines for Using Pound Signs

- **Single Pound Sign (`#`)**: Employ a single pound sign for line-specific comments to explain the purpose of a line or command.
- **Double Pound Signs (`##`)**: Utilize double pound signs for comments that describe the functionality of a code block, such as a loop, conditional sequence, or a list a variables. Once a blank line is placed between the code between the commented code block and the comment, the comment should be considered a new block.
- **Quadruple Pound Signs (`####`)**: Use quadruple pound signs for sectioning parts of the script, such as separating functions, variables, or main script logic.
    - _Please refer to the [Quadruple Pound Signs](#quadruple-pound-signs) section for more details._
- **Triple Pound Signs (`###`)**: Triple pound signs are a mix between double and quadruple pound signs. They are not limited to a single block of code separated by a blank line, but do not represent an entirely new section. Triple pound signs should be use sparingly and only when necessary, as they don't make it clear when a new "section" is starting or ending. Ideally, you should use double or quadruple pound signs instead.

/// details | Examples
//// tab | Single Pound Sign

```bash
src_dir="/path/to/source"  # Source directory to back up.
dest_dir="/path/to/destination"  # Destination directory for the backup.

# Create a backup using rsync.
rsync -av --delete "$src_dir" "$dest_dir"
```

////
//// tab | Double Pound Signs

```bash
## Set source and destination directories.
src_dir="/path/to/source"
dest_dir="/path/to/destination"

## Check if source directory exists, exit if not.
if [[ ! -d $src_dir ]]; then
  echo "Source directory does not exist!"
  exit 1
fi

## Check if destination directory exists, create if not.
if [[ ! -d $dest_dir ]]; then
  echo "Destination directory does not exist. Creating now."
  mkdir -p "$dest_dir"
fi
```

////
//// tab | Triple Pound Signs

Below is a possible situation in which triple pound signs could be used. Note I'll be using quadruple pound signs, which need a more in depth explanation, which is done in the next section.

```bash
####[ Variables ]#######################################################################


## Set source and destination directories.
src_dir="/path/to/source"
dest_dir="/path/to/destination"


####[ Main Code ]#######################################################################


###[ Ensure Directories Exist ]###

## Check if source directory exists, exit if not.
if [[ ! -d $src_dir ]]; then
  echo "Source directory does not exist!"
  exit 1
fi

## Check if destination directory exists, create if not.
if [[ ! -d $dest_dir ]]; then
  echo "Destination directory does not exist. Creating now."
  mkdir -p "$dest_dir"
fi

###[ Backup Files and Check Status ]###

cp -r "$src_dir" "$dest_dir"

if [[ $? -eq 0 ]]; then
  echo "Backup successful."
else
  echo "Backup failed."
fi
```

#### Quadruple Pound Signs

As previously mentioned, quadruple pound signs are used to section off entire parts of the script. This can be used to separate functions, variables, or main script logic. Quadruple pound signs can also be used to represent subsections within a section. Quadruple pound signs should be used sparingly and only there is a need to visually separate one section of code from another.

#### Guidelines for Using Quadruple Pound Signs

- **Sectioning**: Use quadruple pound signs to separate distinct parts of the script, such as functions, variables, or the main script logic.
- **Subsections**: Quadruple pound signs can also be used to represent subsections within a section, providing a clear visual separation between different parts of the script.
- **Sparingly**: Quadruple pound signs should be used sparingly and only when necessary to visually separate one section of code from another.
- **Formatting**: While not required, there is a recommended way to ensure that they stand out from the rest of the comments. After the quadruple pound signs, `[ Section Name ]` should be appended. Next, enter any number of `#` characters the span the total 88 character limit of a single ling. Finally, above and below this line, there must be two blank lines, unless a subsection is created below, to which two blank lines should be used under the subsection.

/// details | Example

```bash
####[ Variables ]#######################################################################
####[[ Modifiable Variables ]]##########################################################


MODIFY_ME="value"


####[[ General Variables ]]#############################################################


general_var="value"


####[ Functions ]#######################################################################


####
# Function description here...
function_name() {
  # Function code here.
}


####[ Main Code ]#######################################################################
#### Main code description here, if necessary...


# Main code here.
```

///

#### Why the Number of Pound Signs Matters

- **Clarity**: Using different numbers of pound signs helps distinguish between comment types, making it easier to identify the comment's scope and purpose.
- **Documentation**: Properly structured comments improve script documentation, making it easier for developers to understand the code's logic and functionality.
